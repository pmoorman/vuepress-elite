Hey, Pieter here... 

First of all: AWESOME to see you here. I'm super glad you're coming onboard!

On the left side you'll find an overview of the 8 different modules.

I recommend you go through them in order... but it's your call. Each module will cost you about ~1-2 hours to work through (+execution :D)

In each module you'll find:

   - Video content
   - A guide book
   - Worksheets
   - Cheatsheets
   - Tools
   - And much more..

Besides that, at the bottom of this page is a huge 'Treasure Vault'... a dump with high-quality links, tools & resources to other content online. You'll love that as you start executing.

I hope you like it, and —most importantly— I hope you can do something with it.

Make it happen!
